Run make to build the binaries and run.sh to run the memory bus covert channel which would initiate communication between the sender and the reader (receiver). The output should be stored in a newly created file called temp.txt and the output should contain a bit sequence of two 1's and one 0's being repeated for a total of 1000 times. This bit pattern is hard coded in sender.cpp and can be changed.
